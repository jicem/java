Various Java programs made for class or just for fun

# Harvard.java

I created this Java program after seeing an article about an alogrithm introduced on the first day of a Computer Science class at Harvard, hence the name. You can find the article here:

The program has been edited for clarity.

# StarWars.java

This program was created for my CSCE 146 class and meant to demonstrate heaps. It reads from the script of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, searches for specific words or phrases, and sorts them into heaps before printing out those heaps.

# Baseball.java

This program simulates a (very basic) baseball game, creating objects for four players and using random number generation to determine whether the ball the pitcher AI throws at each of them will be a hit, a miss, or a home run. Will likely be expanded in the future.
